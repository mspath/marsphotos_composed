# Mars Photos Recomposed

MarsPhotos is a demo app that shows actual images of Mar's surface.

This app demonstrated the use of [Retrofit] to make REST requests to the web service, [Gson] to handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and [Coil] to load images by URL. It is part of the [Android Basics in Compose] course from Google. It is developed in [Unit 5] [Pathway 3] and based on the [Get Data from the Internet] and the [Add Repository and Manual DI] Codelabs.
